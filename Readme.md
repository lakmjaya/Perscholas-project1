# Two Players Betting the random card Game Ver 1.0.0

## How to play

This game will be played between two different live players and computer. Two players will get the chance to select their two different favorite betting cards. Before starting the game both live players should lock their betting choices.

After locking in their selections, the computer will generate a random game card when one of the live players continuously clicks the "Start the Game"

The winner will be the person who matches his/her betting playing card with the computer-generated random card first.

### Rules 
There must be two live players to start the game. The live players must use the drop down-boxes and radio buttons to select their betting choices. The two live players must lock the betting card before starting the game. After completing a game cycle, a live player can restart the game for anyone. For this game, there is no maximum attempt (game cycles).

### Win or Lose the Game
If any of the live player's betting is matched with computer generated playing card. then the computer will respond by displaying messages and changing the border color of the won player as green. 

### Challenges 
There were a few challenges when I was coding the game. The most challenging part of the game is selecting a random playing card picture using 1-52 random numbers.
